A 27-year-old Caucasian female is seen for a follow-up of allergic rhinitis and asthma. She is on immunotherapy (grasses, trees, ragweed, weeds, cat, dust mite), started one year ago for seasonal allergies. She is using Advair to treat her asthma, which are partially relieved by a rescue inhaler use. She has had no nighttime symptoms and no emergency room visits in the past year.
